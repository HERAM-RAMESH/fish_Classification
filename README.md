# fish_Classification
This project applies CNN and Transfer Learning models (VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, InceptionV3, EfficientNetV2B0) to classify 11 fish species. Models were trained on an image dataset with augmentation, evaluated on test data, and deployed using Streamlit for real-time predictions.
